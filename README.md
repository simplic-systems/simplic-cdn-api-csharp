This repository contains the .net / csharp driver to work with the simplic cdn in local networks and in the cloud.
In the following article the basic usage will be explained.

## Samples

This is a sample how to use the api.

### Open a new connection

For opening a new connection, just create a `Cdn` instance and pass an url.

```csharp
using (var cdn = new Cdn("http://localhost:50121/api/v1-0/"))
{
    // Ping the server
    Console.WriteLine("Ping: " + cdn.Ping());
}
```

If you want to test the connection, `Ping()` it.

Now we need to authenticate to do further things:

```csharp
using (var cdn = new Cdn("http://localhost:50121/api/v1-0/"))
{
    // Ping the server
    Console.WriteLine("Ping: " + cdn.Ping());

	// Try to connect
	if (cdn.Connect("<<username>>", "<<password>>"))
    {

	}
}
```

Now we are ready to read and write data.

### Write Data

To write data call the `WriteData` method:

```csharp
// Write data
cdn.WriteData("sample.data", new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 });
```


### Read Data

To read data call the `ReadData` method:

```csharp
// Read data
var data = cdn.ReadData("sample.data");
```
